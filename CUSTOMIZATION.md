Customization
=============

- NOTE: Customization requires basic html/css/javascript knowledge.


Instructions
-------------

- Set the `CUSTOME_HOME` environment variable.
- Copy the contents of the demo directory to `CUSTOM_HOME` directory.
- The directory should contain **demo.html**, **css** directory and **resources** directory.
- Rename **demo.html** to **custom.html**.

- The default web app page contains links to example pages for each of the plugins.


- The **demo.html** page that was copied is a starting point for customization.
